# Vulpes ðŸ¦Š

**Vulpes** (*Vulpes Vulpes*) is a language inspired by Rust, Python, and Lisp. Designed for rapid prototyping, elegant syntax, instant REPL feedback, and high performance AOT compilation. 

## Project Status

Vulpes is currently in its infancy. I am prototyping in Python to cement the language design and semantics prior to implementation in C++.
