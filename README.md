# CUSS

**CUSS** (*Customizable Universal Syntax System*) is a minimalist, Lisp-descended language that ditches the parentheses in favor of a more readable, whitespace-aware syntax. Designed for rapid prototyping and syntactic freedom, CUSS embraces the spirit of Lisp while inviting a broader audience in.  

Itâ€™s the language for sly coders who want the power of macros, the clarity of indentation, and the charm of a fox with a secret.
